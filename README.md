# Real-Time Search Filter using JavaScript

This project is a lightweight, client-side application that demonstrates how to implement a real-time search filter. As a user types into the search bar, the list of items is dynamically filtered to show only those that match the search query. It's built with fundamental web technologies and focuses on efficient DOM manipulation.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project was a great exercise in reinforcing core JavaScript concepts, including:
-   Manipulating the DOM to dynamically display data.
-   Handling user input with the `keyup` event listener.
-   Using array methods like `.filter()` and `.forEach()` to manage and display data.
-   Building a practical, user-facing feature from scratch.
